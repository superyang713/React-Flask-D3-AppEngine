* Purpose of the app
  1. offline batch prediction.
  2. The webapp displays the AUR plot based on the latest model (assuming the
     model is constantly changing.)

     generate an csv file, containing the prediction result.
  4. The result includes the predicted churned user list and converted user
     list.
  
* Backend Stack

  2. If necessary, use Firestore (NoSQL) or Cloud SQL as database.

* Frontend Stack
  1. ReactJS for building client.
  2. IAP for authentication.
  3. plotly or D3 for visualization of AUC score for choosing appropriate threshold.

* Deployment
  1. GKE as the platform to host both frontend and backend.
